Contribution (plugin for Omeka)
===============================


Summary
-------

This plugin for [Omeka] provides a way to collect stories, images, or other
files from the public and manage those contributions in your Omeka archive as
items. The form can also automatically add a reCAPTCHA box at the bottom of each
form to prevent spam-bots from spamming your website.

For more information, see the [Contribution presentation] on [Omeka] and the
[update] done for Omeka 2.


Installation
------------

Contribution depends on the [Guest User] plugin. You will need to install it
before you can install [Contribution].

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "Contribution".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

Settings are not on the plugin page, but at https://www.example.com/admin/contribution/index.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and database regularly so you can
roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------

See online issues on [Contribution issues] page on GitHub.
